# CS140E Final Project: PIC32 ICSP Programmer on the Raspberry Pi A+
## khuang and choiben214

## What Is It?

We created an external programming tool to load programs on to the PIC32 using the Raspberry Pi A+. Currently, we are still in the process of adding support for loading programs, but the programmer successfully checks for device status and enters the serial execution mode needed to load programs.

## Why?

We worked with the PIC32 in a mechatronics course (ME218B) using an external programming tool (SNAP) and wanted to learn the inner-workings of the programming tool and how it actually loads programs on to the PIC. We also wanted to explore JTAG and ICSP programming.
